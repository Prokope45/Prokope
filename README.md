# django-tech-blog
This project is my portfolio "tech-blog" where I describe my experiences and lessons from topics in information technology. It will be published along with my website, jpaubel.tech, but is programmed in Django where I'll practice CRUD functionality. I plan to incorporate a flask webpage for my investment stock analysis tool, and a travel photo gallery.

TODO:
* Complete outstanding issues that need development.
* Incorporate python-stock-analysis project as a webpage of this project.
* Develop gallery page which shows map of the world where user can select location and observe a series of pictures from that location that I photographed.


## Setup
1. Make setup.sh and runserver.sh executable: `chmod +x setup.sh` then run as `./setup.sh` and `./runserver_debug.sh`
