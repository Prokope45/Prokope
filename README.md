# Prokope.io
This project is my portfolio "tech-blog" where I describe my experiences and lessons from topics in information technology, computer science, and psychology. It is hosted at my [website](https://www.prokope.io), and is programmed in Django where I practice general web-engineering practices.

## Setup
1. Make setup.sh and runserver.sh executable: `chmod +x setup.sh` then run as `./setup.sh` and `./runserver_debug.sh`
